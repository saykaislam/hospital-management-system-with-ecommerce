                                <p>9. Privacy:<br />
                                    Both parties are obliged to treat confidentially the content of this agreement, as well as all other
                                    information and data they acquire in connection with the partnership, and not use it for purposes outside
                                    the scope of this contract or pass it on to third parties. This obligation is in force for 1 year after the
                                    termination of the contract. Both parties are obliged to follow privacy laws and handle accordingly all
                                    data related to customers, suppliers and business partners.<br />
                                    10. License<br />
                                    (1) THE SECOND PARTY has the right to freely maintain THE FIRST PARTY&amp;#39;s listing and ranking on the
                                    Website. THE SECOND PARTY offers customers the opportunity to give ratings and reviews of THE FIRST
                                    PARTY&amp;#39;s goods and services on the Website and Mobile application, and has the right but not the
                                    obligation to publish these online and make them visible to all customers. THE SECOND PARTY reserves
                                    the right to delete ratings and reviews.<br />
                                    (2) THE SECOND PARTY may scan, transcribe, and publish online THE FIRST PARTY&amp;#39;s listings, logos and
                                    other materials required. THE FIRST PARTY grants to THE SECOND PARTY a royalty-free, perpetual,
                                    unrestricted license to use and distribute any materials provided by FIRST PARTY, for the purpose of
                                    advertising THE SECOND PARTY&amp;#39;s service. In particular, this includes but not limited to use in Google
                                    AdWords campaigns, domain name registrations and other online marketing and search engine
                                    optimization measures.<br />
                                    11. Terms and termination<br />
                                    (1) This agreement is valid as soon as THE FIRST PARTY signs the contract, or fulfils an order referred by
                                    THE SECOND PARTY, and remains valid for a period of 2 years. Termination can occur at any time, with a
                                    period of notice of one month, in writing, by email, post or fax. The revenues generated during this notice
                                    period are still subject to the partnership agreement. The right to immediate termination by either party
                                    for important causes (any action with legal implications such as tax evasion, dealing counterfeit goods,
                                    bankruptcy, etc.) remains unaffected.<br />
                                    (2) The right to immediate termination in particular covers the case where THE FIRST PARTY repeatedly
                                    receives negative ratings and reviews on the Website and Mobile application when these are not
                                    obviously unjustified. Repeatedly providing misleading information or withholding information required
                                    to present THE FIRST PARTY&amp;#39;s items is also grounds for immediate termination. Typos, mistakes and
                                    transmission errors are excluded from this, as long as they are not caused with intent or by gross
                                    negligence.<br />
                                    (3) THE FIRST PARTY shall be able to terminate the agreement with immediate effect in the event of breach
                                    by THE SECOND PARTY of any material obligation under this agreement, including breach of Clause 2, 3,
                                    4, 5 and 9.<br />
                                    (4) Both parties reserve the right to terminate this agreement if both THE FIRST PARTY and THE SECOND
                                    PARTY mutually agree to terminate.<br />
                                    12. General:<br />
                                    (1) If a single clause in this agreement is invalid, both parties shall endeavor to replace the invalid clause by a
                                    valid one that reproduces as closely as possible the intended economic meaning of the invalid clause. The
                                    validity of the rest of the agreement remains unaffected. This applies in particular if the agreement is
                                    found to be incomplete.<br />
                                    (2) THE SECOND PARTY reserves the right to modify their general terms and conditions without giving any
                                    justification. In that case, THE SECOND PARTY shall give THE FIRST PARTY adequate notice via email.<br />
                                    The notice shall contain advice on the right and period of objection to the changes, and on the
                                    consequences of leaving unexercised the right to object<br />
                                    (3) Any terms and conditions of THE FIRST PARTY are not part of this agreement unless THE SECOND
                                    PARTY expressly agrees to adhere to them in writing.</p>

                                    of the cause of action alleged, the claim will be resolved by arbitration under the Arbitration Act 2001 of
                                    Bangladesh. The place of Arbitration shall be Dhaka, Bangladesh, unless otherwise decided and mutually
                                    agreed between the parties. Each Party will bear its own attorney&amp;#39;s fees and cost related to the arbitration.<br />
                                    14. Governing law<br />
                                    These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the applicable laws of Bangladesh and
                                    the Parties submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts in Bangladesh.<br />
